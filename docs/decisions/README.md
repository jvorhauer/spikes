# Architecture Decision Records

Each and every decision about the architecture of the application and context of this application should be 
recorded in an Architecture Decision Record (ADR).

See [ADR on GitHub](https://adr.github.io/)

## Structure

See [MADR](https://adr.github.io/madr/)

Each ADR consists of 

1. A title (first level of hierarchy)
2. Context
3. Problem definition
4. Considered Options
5. Decision outcome

As far as I am concerned 3 and 4 are optional, important is that the context and decision are clear.
If there is no actual problem, just something to decide and set in stone -for this product- than that information is enough
