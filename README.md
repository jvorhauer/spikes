# Spikes

Some spike stuff in preparation of the final solution to the Note/Blog/Bookmark product that will be the backend for 
one or more Miruvor SaaS offerings.

## Event Sourced

Request -> Command -> Event -> Entity -> Response

1. Request is the instruction from the outside world to perform some task, but not yet a Command
2. After a Request us validated as suitable for a Command, it is transformed into a Command
3. An EventSourcedBehavior handles a Command and checks if the current State is suitable for the Command to be processed
4. If 3 is okay, then the Command is transformed into an Event, persisted and the State is updated accordingly
5. The Event and the State are used to update that State into a new State with the Entity from the Event
6. The requester from step 1 is informed about the result of steps 2..5 in the form of a http status code and the Response from the Entity.

Requests are either a **Create**, **Update** or **Delete** instruction with the required data.
Queries are defined later and return a response of the required entity or a list of these responses.

### Inspiration

The initial idea was to build a simple note-taking backend. Gradually some new features crept in, such as Tasks, Events and Log/Journal entries. 
That scope-creep led to the idea of creating a simple CRM system, with Users logging their activities with Employees of Companies. 
This backend will focus on storing the data created by the users in a traceable, retrievable and recoverable way. The integration with email and
other external systems is not included yet.

Advice is to create branch for each issue, work on that issue-branch and when finished PR. Some overhead, but more
focus and cleaner process. Also update this document when applicable.


## k8s

### ConfigMap

```shell
kubectl create configmap name --from-literal=SECRET_KEY=$ENV_VAR --from-literal=OTHER_SECRET_KEY=$OTHER_ENV_VAR
```

see [k8s docs](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubectl/kubectl-commands#-em-configmap-em-)

### Stuck namespaces

See [SO](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52369247/namespace-stuck-as-terminating-how-i-removed-it)

### deploy to k8s

First, enable necessary k8s services: `dns`, [ingress](https://microk8s.io/docs/addon-ingress) and 
[cert-manager](https://microk8s.io/docs/addon-cert-manager).

As I am using `microk8s` at the moment, this is as easy as 

```shell
microk8s enable dns, ingress, cert-manager
```

on one of the k8s cluster nodes.

In folder `/k8s` in this project there are 5 YAML files.
Apply these as:
1. cluster-issuer.yaml
2. microbot-ingress.yaml
3. service.yaml
4. deployment.yaml
5. spikes-ingress.yaml
